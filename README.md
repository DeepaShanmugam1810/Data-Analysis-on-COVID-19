#Introduction
          
          This paper analyses about the Covid-19 analysis in our country. The dataset consists of 6 columns and 37 rows. The aim of our project is to create awareness among people about the spread of corona virus among the different parts of our country and to stay alert and safe from the disease. By plotting the various graphs using the given data, it has been understood various things like most affected states in the country due to this pandemic. Study of data from various states in the country is combined to show the growth of cases and recovery graph. In this paper, the predictions for September month has been done and Skewness and Kurtosis are done to measure the symmetry. Active status and death status have been done to plot the rigorousness of the disease in our country. Comparison graphs has also been plotted to analyse how much the states in the country are getting affected and recovered. To understand the relation between the cases and months, correlation has been done. To predict the future values the active cases in upcoming months regression has been done. Graphical representations have been done for better understanding. 




#INTRODUCTION
                      
           Corona virus is a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. On 31st December 2019, a seafood market in the Wuhan a city in China, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was reported to World Health organisation. In January 2020, a previously unknown new virus was identified, subsequently named 2019 novel corona virus. WHO has declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic. A pandemic is defined as disease spread over a wide range of geographical area and that has affected high proportion of the population.
                               The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include loss of taste or smell, aches and pains, headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, red eyes, diarrhoea, or a skin rash. Self-care is first and foremost treatment to this disease. It means to wear mask and to sanitise hands regularly and such kind of measures, second is medical treatment. There is no special treatment to protect ourselves from the disease and further step is vaccination is one of the best treatments to protect ourselves from the disease as reduces the severeness and reduces the number of death. It also doesnâ€™t mean that if you are vaccinated you are free from the virus; it actually means that your life is safe from the virus.

DATASET DESCRIPTION  
                            Dataset is created using the data structure concept singly linked list. llist is Linked List Package in Python. This module implements linked list data structures. Currently two types of lists are supported: a doubly linked dllist and a singly linked sllist. Here in this project Singly Linked List Concept (sllist) used for creating the dataset.
